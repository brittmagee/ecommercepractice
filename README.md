## Brittani's CSM Technical Interview | Cypress.io
Hi Tia, Jada, Abram and Jonathan! 

Please reference the information below to get everything up and running. I wanted to use an ecommerce website template to create my tests and CI. 

Hope you enjoy! ~ Brittani

### Cypress.io practice testing site with React.js eCommerce template
#### Website template can be downloaded at [Envato Elements | Stora - React Ecommerce NextJs, ReactHooks...](https://elements.envato.com/stora-react-ecommerce-nextjs-reacthooks-WUYFYPQ)
#### If you would like to check out the actual store from the artist, Marco, you may visit his website [Masterminds Connect](https://mastermindsconnect.com/)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to see the result.
